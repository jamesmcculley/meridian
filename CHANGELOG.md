## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Renamed `meridian-core` to `meridian-detect` and added a CLI scaffold for
  current config output and planned detection workflow commands.
- Updated bootstrap, Makefile, CI, Docker image, Trivy, README, release notes,
  and structure documentation for the `meridian-detect` rename.
- Removed archived platform-era material from the default branch after tagging it
  as `meridian-v1-platform-archive`.
- Repositioned MERIDIAN as a Kubernetes runtime detection engineering project.
- Rewrote README around the v2 detection workflow.
- Rewrote active architecture and learning-map docs.
- Rewrote `security/README.md` to make this repository the future home for
  detection logic, metadata, sample events, and validation evidence.
- Updated `STRUCTURE.md` for the narrowed v2 scope.
- Updated Python tooling wording to avoid broad observability/platform claims.

### Retained
- Trivy CI scanning.
- Python lint, type check, and test workflow.
- YAML validation.

  building blocks.
- Legacy Compose lab for reference.
