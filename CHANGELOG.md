## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Pivoted project positioning from MERIDIAN v2 Kubernetes runtime detection to
  MERIDIAN LABS, a distributed office security lab for branch, HQ, and cloud
  security architecture practice.
- Rewrote README and architecture documentation around segmentation, secure
  connectivity, host hardening, telemetry, detection, and policy-as-code.
- Added threat model, roadmap, interview positioning, and design-decision docs
  to explain the pivot and preserve useful v2 material.
- Added initial lab module scaffolds, learning tasks, and diagrams placeholder
  for the MERIDIAN LABS roadmap.
- Renamed `meridian-core` to `meridian-detect` and added a CLI scaffold for
  current config output and planned detection workflow commands.
- Updated bootstrap, Makefile, CI, Docker image, Trivy, README, release notes,
  and structure documentation for the `meridian-detect` rename.
- Removed archived platform-era material from the default branch after tagging it
  as `meridian-v1-platform-archive`.
- Repositioned MERIDIAN as a Kubernetes runtime detection engineering project.
- Rewrote README around the v2 detection workflow.
- Rewrote active architecture and learning-map docs.
- Rewrote `security/README.md` to make this repository the future home for
  detection logic, metadata, sample events, and validation evidence.
- Updated `STRUCTURE.md` for the narrowed v2 scope.
- Updated Python tooling wording to avoid broad observability/platform claims.

### Retained
- MERIDIAN v2 observability, Trivy, CI, and `meridian-detect` work as future
  telemetry/detection lab inputs.
- Trivy CI scanning.
- Python lint, type check, and test workflow.
- YAML validation.
- Quickwit, Vector, and Fluent Bit configuration as useful event-pipeline
  building blocks.
- Legacy Compose lab for reference.

### Planned
- Falco runtime rule set.
- Detection catalog schema.
- Sample Falco events.
- Synthetic detection validation tests.
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
- Python event validation, enrichment, and report output.
